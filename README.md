High-Level Approach
The first task, once we get the development environment ready, will be to set up the React Router.
Once we have everything in place, we can start off with creating the website header, which will basically serve as the navigation bar, as in most modern websites.
Next up is the home page building. In this project, we’ll be keeping it simple by showing all our sample products on the homepage.
Then we’ll be setting up the React Context API. The Context API is a component structure provided by the React framework, which enables us to share specific states across all levels of the application. In our project, we’ll need to manage two states: basket (to manage the shopping cart) and user (for managing the details of the currently logged in user).
For setting up the payments functionality, we’ll be using APIs provided by Stripe.
Handling our database and authentication needs to be supported and we’ll be using Firebase for the same. Basically the database will be used to store the login information for the users, but the resource can be used for storing product information as well.
Once we have Firebase setup, we can work on the Login page of our application.
Successful implementation of the above requirements will lead to completion of the core implementation of our e-commerce solution. Next up, deploy!

Primary goals
Create header/navigation bar to navigate between pages.
Create a home page to display products.
Create a login page for user login.
